This is a KDE style icon theme for Mapbender. It is based on the
oo.o icon theme made by Nuno Pinheiro (nf.pinheiro@gmail.com) and others. This can
be downloaded from here: 'http://kde-look.org/content/show.php?content=30987'
As these icons are free to use I created a set of icons for the Mapbender toolbars as my input
for this great piece of software.

It contains all necessary icons for the default mapbender GUI. Furthermore icons will be released
as resources pack.

Additionally a sandclock with four wandering stars and a tree in kde look is available.

The default size of the icons is 28x28 pixels.
Measure icons (for getArea... and so on) are 24x24 pixels.
All icons were created with a transparency (which might not work in the buggy IE, sorry).

CREDITS:
Special thnx to the artists sharing their artwork.
To the guys and girls programming, testing and improving Mapbender (especially to all who know whom I mean...).
To my company - which payed for this ;-).

LICENSE:
I put nothing more on it than it was intended by the creator of the icon set originally - so feel free to 
use this set as you like. If you want to - donate (time or money) to an OSS project.
