Testing PHP

Testing javascript
------------------


Write a testfile as described here:
http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit

and include 

  prefix = environment['user.dir'];
  load(prefix +  "/tools/testframework.js");

As well as 

load(prefic + "../http/javascript/mod_test.js") 

at the top to load the testframework and the file you want to test

then add a line like:
	java -jar env-js/rhino/js.jar javascript/test.js

to "tests/Makefile"


This process can probably be greatly improved, but for now this works
